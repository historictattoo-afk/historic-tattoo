  // General
  {
    category: "General",
    question: "Do I need an appointment to get a tattoo?",
    answer: "No! Walk-ins are welcome every day from 11am to 7pm. If you want to book with a specific artist, you can message them on Instagram or call us at (503) 236-3440.",
  },
  {
    category: "General",
    question: "What style of tattoos do you specialize in?",
    answer: "We specialize in traditional American tattooing — bold lines, solid color, and timeless imagery. Think eagles, roses, anchors, skulls, daggers, and classic flash designs that have stood the test of time.",
  },
  {
    category: "General",
    question: "How long has Historic Tattoo been open?",
    answer: "Historic Tattoo has been Portland's home of traditional American tattooing since 2007 — that's over 17 years. Our team of 8 artists brings 109 years of combined experience.",
  },
  {
    category: "General",
    question: "Where are you located?",
    answer: "We're at 2001 SE 50th Ave, Portland, OR 97215 — in the Foster-Powell neighborhood of SE Portland, near SE Division St. Free street parking is available.",
  },
  // Pricing
  {
    category: "Pricing",
    question: "How much does a tattoo cost in Portland?",
    answer: "Tattoo pricing depends on size, detail, and placement. Our Get What You Get tattoos start at $100, and GWYG Deluxe and Tattoo Plinko are $200 each. For custom work, your artist will give you a quote based on your design. Come in or call for a free consultation.",
  },
  {
    category: "Pricing",
    question: "What payment methods do you accept?",
    answer: "We accept cash, all major credit cards (Visa, Mastercard, Amex), and Apple Pay. There is no ATM on-site, so bring your preferred payment method.",
  },
  {
    category: "Pricing",
    question: "Do you require a deposit for appointments?",
    answer: "For most walk-in flash and traditional work, no deposit is needed. For larger custom pieces that require a consultation and drawing time, your artist may request a deposit that goes toward the final cost.",
  },
  // First Tattoo
  {
    category: "First Tattoo",
    question: "What's the minimum age to get a tattoo in Oregon?",
    answer: "In Oregon, you must be 18 years old to get a tattoo. We require a valid government-issued photo ID (driver's license, passport, or state ID). We do not tattoo minors, even with parental consent.",
  },
  {
    category: "First Tattoo",
    question: "Does getting a tattoo hurt?",
    answer: "Everyone's pain tolerance is different, but most people describe it as a scratching or burning sensation. Traditional tattoos with bold lines tend to be quicker sessions. Our artists will work with you to make sure you're comfortable throughout the process.",
  },
  {
    category: "First Tattoo",
    question: "How should I prepare for my tattoo appointment?",
    answer: "Eat a good meal before you come in, stay hydrated, and get a good night's sleep. Wear comfortable clothing that gives easy access to the area being tattooed. Avoid alcohol for 24 hours before your session — it thins the blood and can affect the tattoo.",
  },
  {
    category: "First Tattoo",
    question: "How do I take care of my new tattoo?",
    answer: "We provide detailed aftercare instructions with every tattoo. The basics: keep it clean, moisturized, and out of direct sunlight for 2-3 weeks. Check out our full aftercare guide for step-by-step instructions.",
  },
  // Get What You Get
  {
    category: "Get What You Get",
    question: "What is Get What You Get?",
    answer: "Get What You Get is our signature tattoo experience. You buy a $100 token, spin the wheel, and whatever it lands on is your tattoo. Every design is a hand-painted traditional American flash piece. No picking, no deliberating — just fun.",
  },
  {
    category: "Get What You Get",
    question: "Can I choose where the Get What You Get tattoo goes on my body?",
    answer: "Yes! While you can't choose the design, you absolutely get to choose where on your body the tattoo goes. Your artist will work with you on placement.",
  },
  {
    category: "Get What You Get",
    question: "What's the difference between GWYG, GWYG Deluxe, and Tattoo Plinko?",
    answer: "Get What You Get ($100) is the classic — spin the wheel, get a traditional flash tattoo. GWYG Deluxe ($200) is the same game but with a bigger canvas and bolder designs from our extended flash collection. Tattoo Plinko ($200) uses a Plinko board instead of a wheel — drop the puck and let physics decide your tattoo.",
  },
  {
    category: "Get What You Get",
    question: "Can I veto a Get What You Get design?",
    answer: "That's the whole point — you get what you get! But every design on the wheel is a quality traditional piece that our artists are proud of. Trust the process, and you'll walk out with a great tattoo and a great story.",
